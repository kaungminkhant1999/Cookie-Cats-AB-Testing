# Cookie-Cats-AB-Testing

Overview
  - Cookie Cats is a very popular game developed by Tactile Entertainment. 
  - As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress.
  - These gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged.
